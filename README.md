[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KarthikChapa/VuenCode/blob/main/vuencode.ipynb)

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered video analysis system that combines computer vision and natural language processing to provide comprehensive analysis of video content. The system uses YOLOv8 for object detection and Google's Gemini Vision API for scene understanding, creating an intelligent framework for video content analysis and natural language interaction.

### Actual Interactive Chat System Output

```text
INTELLIGENT VIDEO-CHAT MODE
Hi I am Tanmay captain of this team, Ask me about the analyzed video!

Type your questions below:
================================================================================

 You: what is the weather in the jungle?

 Video Expert: The video analysis does not provide sufficient information to 
 determine the weather in a jungle. The video shows a savanna or grassland 
 environment, not a jungle. Therefore, I cannot answer the question using the 
 data available.

================================================================================

 You: Describe the main characters and their relationships? keep it as a shot 
      and straight response

 Video Expert: Adult cheetah (provider, protector, teacher) and cub (learner, 
 dependent). Strong mother-cub bond. Predator-prey dynamics with gazelles, 
 jackals etc. Unusual, tense cheetah-baboon interaction (possibly competition).

================================================================================

 You: what is the cub learning ?

 Video Expert: Based on the video analysis, the cheetah cub is learning 
 several key survival skills:

 • Hunting and Predation: The cub is observed interacting with and feeding on 
   prey (gazelle, jackal), suggesting it's learning how to manipulate, consume, 
   and potentially hunt or scavenge for food. The adult cheetah's presence 
   during these interactions implies guidance and instruction.

 • Scavenging: At [00:40] the cheetah is carrying an unidentified object - 
   possibly something scavenged. This indicates the cub learns the benefits of 
   scavenging and identifying scavenging opportunities.

 • Predator-Prey Dynamics: The cub's proximity to the adult during 
   hunting/feeding highlights the predator-prey relationship and its role in 
   the ecosystem.

 • Environmental Awareness: The cub's exploration of the grassland environment 
   [00:50] suggests it is learning to identify scents, navigate its habitat, 
   and become familiar with its surroundings.

 • Social Behavior: By following the adult cheetah, the cub is learning social 
   behaviors, communication, and the importance of familial bonds.

 • Guarding prey: The cub is also learning how to guard its kill and ward off 
   other possible threats or scavengers.

 The adult cheetah is actively involved in the cub's learning process through 
 direct instruction, demonstration, and providing a safe environment for 
 exploration and practice.

================================================================================

 You: describe the cinematic techniques are used in this video

 Video Expert: Based on the video analysis, here are the cinematic techniques 
 observed in this wildlife documentary footage:

 • Natural Lighting: The video relies heavily on natural lighting, creating a 
   realistic and immersive viewing experience. Sunlight casts shadows and 
   highlights the textures of grass, animals' fur, and the overall environment.

 • Medium Shots: Frequently employed to capture both cheetahs and their 
   immediate surroundings, providing context for behavior and interactions.

 • Shallow Depth of Field: Used to keep cheetahs in sharp focus while softening 
   background elements, drawing viewer attention to subjects and creating 
   intimacy with the animals.

 • Telephoto Lens: Evident in some shots, compressing space and bringing 
   subjects closer to the viewer. Allows detailed close-ups without disturbing 
   animals in their natural habitat.

 • Composition: Focuses on the relationship between adult cheetah and cub, 
   highlighting familial bond and transfer of hunting skills. Off-center 
   positioning draws attention to cub activities.

 • Static Shots: Relatively static cinematography allows observation of 
   cheetah behavior without excessive camera movement, maintaining calm and 
   naturalism.

 • Color Palette: Warm color palette with golden-brown grasses and warm 
   sunlight creates sense of African savanna's arid climate.

 • Documentary Style: Captured in documentary style with focus on authentic 
   moments of wildlife behavior. Lack of artificial elements enhances realism.

 These techniques combine to create visually appealing and informative wildlife 
 documentary, showcasing natural cheetah behavior in their native habitat.
